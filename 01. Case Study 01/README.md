# Scenario
You are a junior data analyst in the marketing analysis team at Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company in Chicago. The marketing director believes that the future success of the company depends on maximizing the number of annual subscriptions. Your team wants to understand the differences between casual users and annual subscription members and how they use Cyclistic bikes differently to develop a new marketing strategy.
